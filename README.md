DNS (Domain Name System) is like the internet’s phone book. It translates website names (like `google.com`) into IP addresses (like `192.168.1.1`), which are the "addresses" computers use to find and talk to each other.

How DNS Works:
1. You Type a Website: When you type a web address in your browser, the computer sends a request to a DNS **resolver** to find out what IP address goes with that website.
2. Check Cache: If the resolver has seen that website recently, it already knows the IP address and will send it back.
3. Ask Root Servers: If not, the resolver asks a **root server** where to find the website’s top-level domain (like `.com` for `google.com`).
4. Ask TLD Servers: The root server sends the resolver to a **TLD server**, which knows which server has the exact information.
5. Get IP Address: The resolver finally asks the **authoritative server**, which gives the right IP address.
6. Website Loads: The browser uses the IP address to load the website.

DNS makes it easy for people to browse the web by converting easy-to-remember names into computer-friendly addresses.
